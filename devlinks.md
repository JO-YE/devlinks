## Tasks
- the challenge is to build out a link-sharing application and ensure it matches the provided design as closely as possible.

### Feature Implementation:
- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) links with previews.
- Implement form validations for links (ensuring URL correctness) and profile details (ensuring first and last names are provided).
- Allow users to add profile details such as profile picture, first name, last name, and email.
- Enable previewing the devlinks profile and copying the link to the clipboard.
- Ensure optimal layout and responsiveness for different device screen sizes.
- Implement hover and focus states for all interactive elements.
- Ensure only the logged in - owner of the created link has edit access (Back to Editor button should not be visible for other users)

### Full-Stack Application:
- Save details to a database using tools like Firebase, Supabase, or similar.
- Implement user authentication, allowing users to create accounts and log in.
